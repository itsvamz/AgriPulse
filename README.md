# AgriPulse
### This ML Model has been created as a part of the SIH 1647 Problem Statement
#### It requires us to develop AI-ML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetable (onion, potato, onion). We have used Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Model to predict the future prices of any of the 22 commodities upto 1 year in the future, based on the following factors:
    Current Price of Commodity
    Weather
    Temperature
    Rainfall
    Import
    Export
    Natural Calamities
    Festival
    Yield of crop

#### We have also incorporated the use of ML Agents (Price Regulating Agent, Market Sentiment Agent, Supply Chain Agent) to aide in decision making process of buffer-stock management
